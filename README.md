# Implementation of Erosion and Dilation Using OpenCV

## Aim

To write a Python program using OpenCV to perform morphological operations such as Erosion and Dilation on an image.

The program performs the following operations:

- Image Erosion
- Image Dilation

## Software Used

- Anaconda – Python 3.7
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Algorithm

### Step 1:

Import the required libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

### Step 2:

Create a blank image using NumPy.

### Step 3:

Insert text onto the image using OpenCV's text drawing function.

### Step 4:

Display the original image.

### Step 5:

Create a structuring element (kernel) of suitable size.

### Step 6: Image Erosion

- Apply the erosion operation using the created kernel.
- Remove pixels from the boundaries of foreground objects.
- Display the eroded image.

### Step 7: Image Dilation

- Apply the dilation operation using the same kernel.
- Add pixels to the boundaries of foreground objects.
- Display the dilated image.

### Step 8:

Compare the original, eroded, and dilated images.

**Name:** ____________________________

**Register No:** ______________________

## Output

### Original Image

- A text image containing characters is displayed.
- The image serves as the input for morphological processing.

### Erosion

- Original image is displayed.
- Eroded image is displayed.
- The thickness of the characters is reduced.
- Object boundaries shrink inward.

### Dilation

- Original image is displayed.
- Dilated image is displayed.
- The thickness of the characters increases.
- Object boundaries expand outward.

## Result

Thus, the morphological operations **Erosion** and **Dilation** are successfully implemented using OpenCV. Erosion removes pixels from object boundaries and reduces object size, while Dilation adds pixels to object boundaries and increases object size. These operations are widely used for noise removal, image enhancement, segmentation, and shape analysis in image processing applications.
